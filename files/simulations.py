# Bernoulli’s Equation is used to determine fluid velocities through pressure measurements. It starts with qualifications of nonviscous, steady, incompressible flow at a constant temperature.

# P + ½ρv2 + ρgy = constant

# P = pressure

# v = velocity

# ρ = density of the fluid

# g = gravity

# y = height

# p1+V1 = p2+V2
# V1*A1 = V2*A2
